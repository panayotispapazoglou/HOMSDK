The Low-Cost Plug-n-Play Educational Hardware-Oriented Microcomputer Simulator Development Kit (HOMSDK) is a development platform that supports the physical implementation of custom microcomputer architectures. 

The user can build both internal CPU components and other microcomputer components, such as memory. The platform consists of a motherboard (2 pieces in the box) and bricks (8 pieces in the box). 

All bricks are identical, and the corresponding functionality can be defined by the internal software. Thus, each brick can be used as register, control unit, arithmetic and logic unit, memory, etc.
